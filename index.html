<h1 class="title">fathom: a universal system of assessment</h1>
</div>
<p>Fathom is a decentralized protocol for creating and assessing meaningful credentials through the consensus of knowledge communities.</p>
<p>To assess an individual those with relevant experience, as previously proven by this process, are incentivized through token staking and rewards to accurately assess. The protocol makes no assumptions about what is being assessed but instead derives definitions, meaning, and rules from communities and their relationships to each other.</p>
<p>What this creates is a universal credential ecosystem, where individuals are free to learn what they please how they please and earn credentials that enable them to directly and meaningfully interact with anyone in the world</p>

<h2 id="a-more-wide-eyed-explanation">A more wide-eyed explanation:</h2>
<p>Fathom is fundamentally about expanding how we can communicating experience. Society functions on knowing what individuals can do; its how we hire, allocate funds, and even make friends.</p>
<p>As our society scaled up into larger and larger communities we offloaded this process of understanding into institutions which provided certificates and assessments, that could communicate individuals identity extremely effeciently. The problem is the institional model is unscalable, and has been limited to certain experiences that could essentially be mass produced. This produced a chilling effect, where individuals would only aim to accrue the experiences that they could broadly communicate.</p>
<p>This is holding society back. If individuals were free to build their experiences as they fit and towards their unique individual aims, <strong>and still be able to communicate that to any entity in the world</strong>, the things people would be able to accomplish would be incredible.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-ethereum">Why Ethereum</h2>
<p>Fathom is built and deployed as a smart-contract system on Ethereum. This allows the protocol to function without any central point of trust, failure, or control, which is important in the context of credentials for multiple reasons.</p>
<h3 id="self-soverign-identity">Self-Soverign Identity</h3>
<p>Firstly, credentials form identity, and individuals have a right to control over their identity. It should not be able to be destoryed, forged, or otherwise comprimised, by <em>any</em> power. Blockchains, and Ethereum in specific, form a incredible foundation for self-soverign identity. Both the lower level qualities, such as immutability and public-key based accounts, as well higher level concepts, such as proxy contracts and others, form a robust and versatile paradigm for identity management.</p>
<h3 id="protocol-trust-and-incentives">Protocol trust and incentives</h3>
<p>Beyond that, its also important that individuals can trust in the process that generates the credentials themselves. While there is a long tail of value in decentralized attestations, fathom aims to be a singular source of trust. For that to happen individuals need to trust the protocol can't be abused, that it functions as described. This is a coding problem obviously, our smart-contracts have to be robust, but Ethereum enables that robustness once deployed to be guaranteed to execute. This is especially important given we're dealing with economic incentives.</p>
<h3 id="forming-a-foundation">Forming a foundation</h3>
<p>Above all though, fathom exists on ethereum because ethereum enables it to form the foundation for a our future decentralized social systems. Anyone in the world can build using fathom credentials, and anyone else can trust what they build. The systems they build be planetary scale social systems, a new society.</p>
