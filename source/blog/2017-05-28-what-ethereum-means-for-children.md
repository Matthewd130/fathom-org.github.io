My main concern is with how Ethereum and decentralized technologies can change the structure of social credential systems, and in doing so change how education can function. However, there is another area where blockchains can change academics, in the tools and data avaliable to students. 

This may sound mundane, but when taking into account the scale at which blockchain techoogy seems to want to pervade our society, it has some pretty large implications.
