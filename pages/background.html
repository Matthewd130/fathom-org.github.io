<p>Extremely frustrated with the extent to which our education system is failing individuals we set out to build a peer-to-peer learning network, that would enable individuals to self-organize to learn anything they want to.</p>
<p>From the start it was a journey of abstraction. Many of the problems we highlighted in traditional educational models weren't <em>inherently</em> bad, they were just terrible as the only option. We tried to erase our assumptions at every step of the way and build something that allowed for individual choice and agency.</p>
<h1 id="january-2016">January 2016</h1>
<p>We pretty quickly realized that at the at the core of an education system lies an assessment system. If we wanted to organize people to learn, we first had to know about them.</p>
<p>It was evident that centralized assessment solutions couldn't scale how we needed them to. One of the main reasons our current academic models impose their limitations on students is because they're in turn limited by what they can actually assess and build trust in.</p>

<p>After reading a <a href="http://augur.strikingly.com/blog/building-a-better-lie-detector">blog post</a> from the Augur team we had an <em>aha</em> moment for how Ethereum could fit into all of this. We could use a smart-contract system to create the incentives that would allow individuals to come to consensus both on given assessments and larger community definitions.</p>
<h2 id="january-2016-1">January 2016</h2>
<p>We started putting together a pretty naive smart-contract implementation of the protocol.</p>
<h2 id="june-2016">June 2016</h2>
<p>We just about had a functioning smart-contract system by this point, a terrible messy functioning system.</p>
